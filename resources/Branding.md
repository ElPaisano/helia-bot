## Naming

Helia as a proper noun is referred to as "Helia" with a capital H.

Helia (*HEE-lee-ah*) is the Latin spelling of Ἡλιη -- in Greek mythology, one of the [Heliades](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12656412): the daughters of the sun god Helios. When their brother Phaethon died trying to drive the sun chariot across the sky, their tears of mourning fell to earth as amber, which is yellow (sort of), and so is JavaScript. They were then turned into [poplar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poplar) trees and, well, JavaScript is quite popular.

In Oct–Dec 2022, [PL EngRes IP Stewards](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/IP-Stewards-9b65f88602474557b5d6f644194e941f) [sought community input](https://github.com/ipfs/pomegranate/issues/3) for the name of this project. After considering 20 suggestions and holding a couple of polls, the name **Helia** was chosen. Here's [why "ipfs" is not in the name](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/470).
